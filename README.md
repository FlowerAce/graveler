# Graveler

## Prelude

I was deeply nerd snipped by Austin, when he said the magic words contest I immediately run to my computer just to make this.
The first thing I did was basically recreate it in Rust, which is faster, but I didn't let it run for very long, and I thought of adding paralelism.
The faster way to add paralelisim in Rust (afaik) is rayon which provides you with very nice utils to do so.

## The runner

I have made a basic runner that basically gets all the code an runs it and times it, I am too lazy to make it neat but I might do it to time the attempts.
